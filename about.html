  <h2>👋 Welcome to The Dine</h2>
  <p><strong>The Dine</strong> is a modern Asian cuisine restaurant that celebrates the rich culinary traditions of the East. Our dishes are crafted using authentic recipes, vibrant spices, and a deep respect for cultural heritage — all served in a stylish, contemporary setting.</p>
  
  <p>We believe great food is more than just a meal — it reflects a lifestyle. That’s why every dish we serve is prepared with passion, precision, and purpose. Our main motive is to serve food that is both tasty and healthy — something not easy to achieve. There’s a common myth that “taste and health can’t go hand in hand,” but <strong>The Dine</strong> proves otherwise. Thanks to our passionate food research team and expert chefs, we have created a menu that satisfies both.</p>
  
  <p>When it comes to the food itself, you’ll experience everything from the sizzling aromas of street-style stir-fry to the comforting balance of traditional curries and noodles. Our menu reflects a flavorful journey through Asia’s most beloved food cultures.</p>
  
  <p>At The Dine, our mission is simple: to offer warm hospitality, delicious food, and a memorable dining experience that brings people together — one bite at a time.</p>
